#### Unusual Layout

While designers have grown familiar with chaos over the past few years, web design has tried to find order among the mess. But now, Kadussi says, designers are embracing the wreckage. Welcome to the world of anti-design. 

With its roots in Brutalism, anti-design draws on harsh qualities that aim to break the principles of design, re-create the chaos around us and make a strong observational statement. This web trend is characterized by heavy, aggressive elements that broken and disproportional in appearance, such as clashing textures, overlapping elements, big fonts and asymmetrical, unstructured layouts. 

Because designers use anti-design to push creative limits and connect with new audiences, this attention-grabbing style won't fit every website and brand. Kadussi points out that many online businesses like e-commerce depend on having a specific website structure and user flow, so anti-design’s nature may limit its success. However, if you have a portfolio, special project, campaign or initiative, anti-design may help you portray a specific subtext. For example, the style helped the New York Times convey the detritus of constant climate catastrophe in this web package.

#### Custom illustrations

Web pages that replace photography with illustrations are becoming a popular web design trend. Custom illustrations have many benefits. They can make your website look better, explain complex ideas simply, and help guide visitors. They can improve your website's search engine ranking too. With Google’s continued push for quick load times through its Core Web Vitals page experience measurements, more web designers and developers are looking for ways to speed up web pages.

Finally, a custom, unique illustration that doesn’t exist anywhere else on the web can be a fantastic way to capture users’ attention and imagination. Spending the extra time and budget on a high-quality, original illustration, not just a recycled stock illustration, can benefit your brand greatly.

#### Cursor-Centric Interactivity

Custom cursors are currently one of the biggest trends in website design. A custom website cursor could initially appear to be another piece of design. But this design idea is far more complex. The cursor is the primary element that connects the user and the website while using a desktop device to visit a website. You can really use this cursor to your advantage to increase website interaction and engagement rates like never before if you’re clever enough.

#### Grid and Modular design

Grids are merely one of the many tools at a graphic designer’s disposal. Modern-day innovations provide designers with ample opportunities: in the early 1990s, at the dawn of the internet, websites were designed using HTML tables. Designers either chose to use grids or ignored their existence altogether depending on what they saw fit. 

With the adoption of mobile devices, design approaches had to be revised. Designers realized that complex design looks horrible on smartphone screens, while catchy animated banners often only irritate users. Moreover, some elements had to be removed or simplified to help with the loading speed. It is very common to use column grids to create adaptive websites.

#### Dynamic 3D experiences

Many gaming UIs have a sci-fi or futuristic design aesthetic, with glowing edges, holographic elements, and complex motion graphics. Web designers are increasingly drawing inspiration from this style, integrating 3D, intricate UI details and detailed microinteractions to create an atmosphere of high-tech immersion.

Web designers are now borrowing the visually-complex and dynamically-interactive aesthetics pioneered by game designers that gamers have long appreciated, translating these visual cues into broader digital experiences across websites and applications.

The aesthetic manifests through layered visual elements that simulate advanced digital environments, featuring translucent panels, augmented reality-inspired experiences, and interactive components that respond with cinematic fluidity. By integrating 3D-like depth, sophisticated microinteractions, and color palettes reminiscent of sci-fi games — electric blues, stark whites, and neon accents — these web designs create an immersive experience that feels simultaneously futuristic and intuitively navigable.

#### Playful interactive websites

Adobe Flash transformed web to experimental in the late 90s and early 2000s, websites went from static information repositories to dynamic, interactive playgrounds. Designers were able to create intricate animations, immersive experiences, games, and websites that were inherently interactive. It was an era marked by design that celebrated and prioritized experience over pure functionality — and where websites could be unpredictable, whimsical, and entirely unique.

Today's designers are recapturing that spirit of creative freedom, but with significant improvements thanks to modern animation and design technologies like GSAP (whose parent company was recently acquired by Webflow), Rive and Spline.

But it’s important to note that this trend goes beyond mere technical recreation. Designers are deliberately invoking the playful, slightly chaotic aesthetic of early web experiences — bringing back bold animations, unexpected interactions, and a sense of digital spontaneity.

“The early web felt human and subversive, full of internet art, interactivity and sparkly cursors,” Cassie Evans, Developer Relations Engineer at GSAP, observes. “With the death of Flash, we swung back hard in the other direction – looking at you Web2.0 – but it feels like the cultural pendulum is stabilizing again. Animated loaders are back (contentious, I know), alongside fun 404 pages, konami codes, and cursor interactions. It feels like people are pushing the boundaries again, crafting a little human high-five from creator to user across the internet, which, in an era of algorithmic feeds and AI-generated content, is more important than ever.”

#### Scroll-To-Engage stories 

The evolution of scrolling techniques in web design has transformed how users interact with digital content, turning what was once a mundane navigation function into a dynamic, storytelling experience. This trend goes far beyond traditional scrollytelling, reimagining scroll interactions as a fundamental design language that creates depth, narrative, and visual excitement throughout a web experience. 

Scroll-based animations and interactions have become sophisticated storytelling techniques that breathe new life into websites. Designers are building advanced scrolls to create experiences that respond dynamically to user movement: revealing content, triggering animations, and creating multi-layered visual narratives. 

This trend is a result of the combined demand of unique ways to communicate ideas on the web, in tandem with faster devices, browsers, and bandwidths across the web that can handle the constant, smooth animation of elements as you scroll through a page. “Scroll-triggered animations are also a more natural, expected way for users to experience content because it is directly associated with their actions as they navigate the page, as opposed to time-based animations that may not be experienced exactly as intended by the creator,”.

Some of the most compelling applications of animated scroll-based design we’ve seen so far are in the world of data and product visualizations, using JavaScript libraries like Three.js and GSAP to build animated scrolls that progressively reveal information and product imagery in a more immersive format. As users move through a page, complex graphics can unfold, data points can animate into view, and entire visual landscapes can transform — making content consumption a more engaging and interactive experience.

These more advanced applications of scroll-based design also reflect a broader shift in web design and user behavior — from passive consumption to active exploration. Users are no longer simply reading or viewing content; they are actively participating in its revelation, making for more engaging and memorable user experiences.

#### Radient Glow design

Designers are embracing the use of luminous aesthetics that include sophisticated glows and light blooms. This approach transforms designs into vibrant, almost ethereal experiences that create depth, emphasize interaction, and introduce a sense of dynamic energy. “Glows can be used to serve greater functional purposes: to enhance and feature different aspects of design compositions and illustrate a sense of power,” says Johnnie Gomez Alzaga, Staff Brand Designer at Webflow.

With traces back to everything from digital photography, to video games, to Y2K aesthetics, these radiant effects simulate the way light interacts with surfaces in both digital and physical environments. More specifically, they often mimic the way light behaves on high-end displays and advanced screens, borrowing visual language from OLED technologies and retina displays.

Glows subtly draw attention to interactive elements, create a sense of depth, and provide visual feedback that makes websites feel more responsive. Designers strategically use them around buttons, navigation elements, and key visual components to create a sense of illumination and realism. 

These light effects range from subtle, almost imperceptible halos to more dramatic, vibrant blooms that seem to pulse and breathe as users interact with them. “Glows are a way to incorporate hardware materiality into a website. They’re challenging to realistically build, making them a great focus piece for designers, but they also support a page’s function by pulling users’ eyes towards the area they should focus on,” explains Meg Wayne, Staff Brand Designer at Webflow.

By simulating the way light naturally diffuses and reflects, the use of glows suggests movement, responsiveness, and a kind of luminescence that makes web experiences feel more alive and interactive. This technique also mirrors advancements in tech: as screens become more high-definition and our digital experiences become more immersive, these light and glow effects represent an emerging, nuanced approach to making web design feel more human, more responsive, and more connected to our sensory experiences of light and interaction.

#### AI content

AI tools can provide the power and ease designers need when they want to explore visual concepts. From detailed, stylized illustrations to hyper-realistic product visualizations, AI-generated imagery allows for a level of creative exploration that previously may have been too expensive or time-consuming to undertake otherwise.

Simultaneously, tools like Midjourney and Visual Electric have changed the game when it comes to using AI to generate custom, highly-stylized imagery and illustrations. And these aren’t just solutions for non-designers; a growing number of seasoned creative professionals are actively incorporating AI-generated visuals into their designs depending on project needs. 

This is a notable shift from the traditional methods of how visual content has been conceptualized and created, but one that design leaders like Pentagram’s Paula Scher welcomes, who recently defended her agency’s use of Midjourney for a government website.

Generative AI is reshaping the entire concept of visual design, challenging traditional boundaries between generated and created imagery. And the designers embracing it are also increasingly becoming orchestrators of visual generation, using AI as a powerful creative tool that extends their own creative capabilities.

### Scroll driven animations

A scroll-driven animation is an animation that responds to scrolling. There’s a direct link between scrolling progress and the animation’s progress. Scroll-driven animations are different than scroll-triggered animations, which execute on scroll and run in their entirety. Scroll-driven animations pause, play, and run with the direction of the scroll. It sounds to me like scroll-triggered animations are a lot like the CSS version of the JavaScript intersection observer that fires and plays independently of scroll.

#### CSS classes

Ik heb de `section` een volledige viewport height gegeven voor zodat het eenvoudige kan scrollen. Door de viewtimeline kan de er getracked worden wanneer er gehorizontaal moet worden gescrolled.

Bij `.pin-wrap-sticky` is de property `position: sticky;` meegegeven zodat het in beeld blijft tijdens het scrollen. De `.pin-wrap` wordt uiteindelijk geanimeerd op de `viewtimeline`. Verder staan er properties voor de positie bij `.pin-wrap` class, hierdoor kan alles zichtbaar worden tijdens de horizontal scroll.

```
section {
	    height: 100vh;
	    overflow: visible; /* for position sticky */
	    view-timeline-name: --section-pin-tl;
	    view-timeline-axis: block;
    }

    .pin-wrap-sticky {
	    height: 100vh;
            overflow-x: hidden;
            position: sticky;
	    top: 0;
	    width: 100vw;
    }

    .pin-wrap {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: row;
            justify-content: flex-start;
	    height: 100vh;
	    width: 600vmax;

	 /* Hook animation */
	    will-change: transform;
	    animation: linear move forwards;

	  /* Link animation to view-timeline */
	    animation-timeline: --section-pin-tl;
	    animation-range: contain 10% contain 66.5%;
    }
```

#### CSS keyframes

```
   @keyframes move {

        /* moves horizontally, right edge is aligned against viewport */
	to { transform: translateX(calc(-100% + 100vw)); }

    }
```

### Container queries

Container queries are often considered a modern approach to responsive web design where traditional media queries have long been the gold standard — the reason being that we can create layouts made with elements that respond to, say, the width of their containers rather than the width of the viewport.

```
.l-d { 
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: nowrap;
        gap: 1.5em;
        overflow: scroll;
        width: 90%;
        scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
        container: card-banner / inline-size;
}

@container card-banner (min-width: 450px) {
        article {
            min-width: 24.75em;
        }
    }

    @container card-banner (min-width: 750px) {
        article {
            min-width: 38em;
            height: 37em;
        }

        article img {
            min-height: 52%;
            max-width: unset;
        }

        .a-d {
            max-height: 15.5em;
            min-width: 95%;
        }

        .a-d div {
            flex-direction: row;
        }

        .a-d div p {
            width: 21em;
        }
    }
```

### View Transitions API 

There are a number of use cases where a smooth visual transition can make the user experience more engaging. When a thumbnail image on a product listing page transitions into a full-size image on the product detail page, for example, or when you have a fixed navigation bar that stays in place as you navigate from one page to another. The View Transitions API helps us create seamless visual transitions between different views on a site.

View transitions can be triggered not only on a single document but also between two different documents. Both rely on the same principle: The browser takes snapshots of the old and new states, the DOM gets updated while rendering is suppressed, and the transitions are powered by CSS Animations.

### Anchor-positioning

Whether you use it for footnotes, tooltips, connector lines, visual cross-referencing, or dynamic labels in charts, the CSS Anchor Positioning API enables us to natively position elements relative to other elements, known as anchors. In her introduction to the CSS Anchor Positioning API, Una Kravets summarized in detail how anchor positioning works. She takes a closer look at the mechanism behind anchor positioning, how to tether to one and multiple anchors, and how to size and position an anchor-positioned element based on the size of its anchor. Browser support is still limited, so you might want to use the API with some precautions. Una’s guide includes what to watch out for.

### Exclusive Accordions

The ‘exclusive accordion’ is a variation of the accordion component. It only allows one disclosure widget to be open at the same time, so when a user opens a new one, the one that is already open will be closed automatically to save space. Thanks to CSS, we can now create the effect without a single line of JavaScript. 

To build an exclusive accordion, we need to add a name attribute to the <details> elements. When this attribute is used, all <details> elements that have the same name value form a semantic group and behave as an exclusive accordion. Bramus Van Damme summarized in detail how it works.

https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/exclusive-accordion?hl=nl

### :has

Historically, CSS selectors have worked in a top-down fashion, allowing us to style a child based on its parent. The new CSS pseudo-class :has works the other way round: We can now style a parent based on its children. But that’s not all yet. Josh W. Comeau wrote a fantastic introduction to :has in which he explores real-world use cases that show what the pseudo-class is capable of.

https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/has/

### high-definition colors

With high-definition colors with LCH, okLCH, LAB, and okLAB that give us access to 50% more colors, the times of RGB/HSL might be over soon. Both OKLCH and OKLAB are based on human perception and can specify any color the human eye can see. While OKLAB works best for rich gradients, OKLCH is a fantastic fit for color palettes in design systems. OKLCH/OKLAB colors are fully supported in Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox, and Opera. Figma doesn’t support them yet.

### Relative Colors In CSS

Let’s say you have a background color and want to reduce its luminosity by 25%, or you want to use a complementary color without having to calculate it yourself. The relative color syntax (RCS) makes it possible to create a new color based on a given color. To derive and compute a new color, we can use the from keyword for color functions (color(), hsl(), oklch(), etc.) to modify the values of the input color.

### text-wrap: balance

By applying the text-wrap: balance property, the browser will automatically calculate the number of words and divide them equally between two lines — perfect for page titles, card titles, tooltips, modals, and FAQs, for example. Ahmad Shadeed wrote a helpful guide to text-wrap: balance in which he takes a detailed look at the property and how it can help you make your headlines look more consistent.

When dealing with large blocks of text, such as paragraphs, you might want to look into text-wrap: pretty to prevent orphans on the last line.
